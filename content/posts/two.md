# Adding photos

Photographs can be added to a post with this syntax:

> ![alternative description](location of image)

Be sure to save images inside the folder /static/images. 

When images are saved there, the location is: "/images/imagename"

![owl](/images/owlpink.png)

To maintain site performance, keep images small in size.
